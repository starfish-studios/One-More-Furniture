# CHANGELOG
## Toads
- Toads are passive mobs, known for their warty skin and chonkier bodies. Unlike their relatives, Frogs, they are terrestrial and found in habitats such as Forests and Plains.
- Toads' diets primarily consist of mobs such as Worms, but they may also eat things such as Endermites, Silverfish, Slimes, and Snails if given the opportunity.
  - Luckily, Worms are their favorite food! Plentiful Worms about the world are definitely not a complaint from them.
- Unlike Frogs, Toads do not attack mobs using their tongue. Instead, they jump towards their prey and gobble them up in one bite. _(Due to their high damage to consume these mobs, Toads will never attack the Player.)_
- Toads spawn in solitary numbers of 1 in Forests and Plains.
- Toads can be tamed with Worms, and commanded to sit. They will not follow the player when tamed.
  - _**( ! )**_ Considering changing this, as their mouths will be used for inventory space. Maybe they could ride on the Player and act like a backpack?
- Toads can be bred with Slime Balls, and upon doing so, they will lay their eggs on a nearby water source.
  - If they can't find a water source, they will lay their eggs on the ground, and the eggs will slowly break instead of hatching.
  - If the player picks up the eggs, they can place them in a water source to hatch them and avoid letting them die.
- Toads have a 50% chance to replace Black Cats in Witch Huts!
